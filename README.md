# mpv-autoplaylistresume
A mpv script to autoplay the last played item in a playlist. Currently only supports m3u files.

## Possible future additions
- [ ] Allow using folders as a playlist and autoresume when dropping a folder into mpv (don't know if this is possible, but I definitely want it)
- [ ] Allow saving that playlist (filtering out subtitle files) into m3u files to just allow this current code to take over
